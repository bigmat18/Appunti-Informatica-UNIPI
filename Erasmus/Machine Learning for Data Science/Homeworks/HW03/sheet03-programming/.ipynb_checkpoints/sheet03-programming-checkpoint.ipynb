    "In this exercise we perform a principal component analysis of the Iris dataset, a famous dataset from Fisher (1936) which one can access from sklearn.

What these measurements correspond to is depicted in the image below.\n",

Additionally, some logarithmic transformation of the input features is performed so that a difference between e.g. 5mm and 6mm is given roughly the same importance as a difference between 5cm and 6cm. Such log-scaling gives more focus on features measuring smaller objects, compared to an approach based on the raw measurements. Also, we add a small increment of 1mm before applying the log-transform to ignore very small quantities that cannot be precisely measured."
